# Call for Papers

In the last decade, substantial progress has been made w.r.t. the performance of computer vision systems, a significant part of it thanks to deep learning. These advancements prompted sharp community growth and a rise in industrial investment. However, most current models lack the ability to reason about the confidence of their predictions; integrating uncertainty quantification into vision systems will help recognize failure scenarios and enable robust applications.

The ECCV 2022 workshop on Uncertainty Quantification for Computer Vision will consider recent advances in methodology and applications of uncertainty quantification in computer vision. Prospective authors are invited to submit papers on relevant algorithms and applications including, but not limited to:

* Applications of uncertainty quantification
* Failure prediction (e.g., OOD detection)
* Robustness in CV
* Safety critical applications in CV
* Domain-shift in CV
* Probabilistic deep models
* Deep probabilistic models
* Deep ensemble uncertainty
* Connections between NNs and GPs
* Incorporating explicit prior knowledge in deep learning
* Computational aspects and real-time probabilistic inference
* Output ambiguity, multi-modality and diversity

Papers will be peer-reviewed, and accepted papers are presented at the workshop and included in the ECCV Workshop Proceedings.
