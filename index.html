<div class="jumbotron information">

<p>In the last decade, substantial progress has been made w.r.t. the performance of computer vision systems, a significant part of it thanks to deep learning. These advancements prompted sharp community growth and a rise in industrial investment. However, most current models lack the ability to reason about the confidence of their predictions; integrating uncertainty quantification into vision systems will help recognize failure scenarios and enable robust applications.</p>

<p>In addition to advances in Bayesian deep learning, providing practical approaches for vision problems, the workshop will provide a forum for discussing promising research directions, which have received less attention, as well as advancing current practices to drive future research. Examples include: the development of new metrics that reflect the real-world need for uncertainty when using vision systems with down-stream tasks; and moving beyond point-estimates to address the multi-modal ambiguities inherent in many vision tasks.</p>

<p>This workshop aims to raise the vision community's awareness about uncertainties surrounding the model, data, and predictions. Moreover, bringing together experts from ML and vision will create a new generation of well-calibrated and effective methods that know when they do not know.</p>
